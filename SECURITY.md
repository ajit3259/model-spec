# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We're extremely grateful for security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities they discovered in modelpack.
All reports are thoroughly reviewed and investigated.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

You should report if:

- You think you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in modepack
- You are uncertain about the security impact of an issue you found in modelpack.

### How to Report a Vulnerability?

Please report a vulnerability using GitHub’s [Security Advisories](https://github.com/modelpack/model-spec/security).
**Do not create a public issue, pull request, or discussion**.

To submit a report, navigate to the repository's main page, open the **Security** tab, select **Advisories** from the sidebar,
click **Report a vulnerability**, provide the required details, and submit.
This process will create a private advisory visible only to the maintainers for review.

### Security Vulnerability Response

Our maintainers will review and respond to your report within **5 working days**. Depending on the severity and complexity of the issue, resolution times may vary, but we will keep you informed throughout the process.

### Supported Versions

We only provide security fixes for the latest major version.

| Version       | Security Fixes Provided |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| `@latest`     | Yes                     |
| Older versions| Not Guaranteed          |

### Public Disclosure Timing

The disclosure date will be agreed upon between the **modelpack** maintainers and the reporter.  
In general:

- Immediate disclosure may occur if the issue is already public.  
- For vulnerabilities with straightforward fixes, disclosure is typically within **7 days** of the report.  
- For complex issues requiring more time to investigate and validate fixes, disclosure may be delayed—up to a maximum of **90 days**.  

Delays may also be necessary if the bug or fix is not yet fully understood or adequately tested.
