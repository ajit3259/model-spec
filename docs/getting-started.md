# Getting Started with CNCF ModelPack Specification

Welcome to the CNCF ModelPack Specification project! This guide will help you understand the specification and its role in the broader AI/ML ecosystem, as well as providing practical steps to get started.

## What is the ModelPack Specification?

The CNCF ModelPack Specification is an open standard for packaging, distributing, and running AI models in cloud-native environments. It builds upon the proven [OCI (Open Container Initiative) image specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/) to bring the same standardization and interoperability benefits that containers brought to application deployment to the world of AI models.

### Why This Matters

We are entering the fourth age of infrastructure evolution:

1. **Machine-centric** (GNU/Linux distributions)
2. **Virtual Machine-centric** (Cloud computing, virtualization)
3. **Container-centric** (Docker, Kubernetes, OCI standards)
4. **AI Model-centric** (Current era - AI model development and deployment)

Just as OCI standards revolutionized how we package and distribute applications, the ModelPack specification aims to standardize AI model packaging and distribution, moving away from vendor-specific formats toward an open, interoperable standard.

## The ModelPack Ecosystem

The ModelPack specification is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing cloud-native and AI/ML tools. Here's how the key components work together:

### Core Infrastructure

This section lists the core infrastructure components that ModelPack is working with.

- **[OCI Registries](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)**: Store model artifacts using the same proven infrastructure as container images. One example of such implementation of an OCI registry is **[Harbor](https://goharbor.io/)**, which provides enterprise-grade OCI registry service that can host model artifacts with security scanning, policy management, and RBAC.
- Model distribution service: Provide efficient model artifacts distribution. One example of such implementation is **[Dragonfly](https://d7y.io/)**, a P2P-based file distribution system at scale.

### Model Management Tools

- **[modctl](https://github.com/modelpack/modctl)**: CLI tool for building, pushing, pulling, and managing OCI model artifacts
- **[KitOps](https://kitops.ml/)**: ModelKit packaging and deployment platform that supports the ModelPack specification

### Kubernetes Integration

- **[Model CSI Driver](https://github.com/modelpack/model-csi-driver)**: Kubernetes CSI driver for mounting model artifacts as persistent volumes
- **[OCI Volume Sources](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/16/kubernetes-1-31-image-volume-source/)**: Mount model artifacts directly as volumes in Kubernetes pods without init containers
- **[CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/)**: Container runtime that supports OCI artifacts, enabling seamless model deployment in Kubernetes environments

## Key Benefits

- **Standardization**: The use of familiar OCI tooling and infrastructure for AI models
- **Interoperability**: Models packaged once work across different platforms and tools
- **Security**: Leverage existing OCI security features like image signing and vulnerability scanning
- **Efficiency**: Native Kubernetes integration eliminates the need for manually downloading models
- **Versioning**: The use of OCI tags and digests enables robust model version control
- **Ecosystem**: Build on top of the mature container ecosystem, rather than creating new infrastructure and components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of containers and OCI concepts
- Access to an OCI-compatible registry (Docker Hub, Harbor, etc.)

### Practical Steps

#### 1. Install modctl

Follow the instructions to install `modctl` from the [modctl GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelpack/modctl/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#installation) to install the CLI tool.

#### 2. Install Model CSI Driver

If you plan to use models in Kubernetes, install the Model CSI Driver by following the instructions in the [Model CSI Driver repository](https://github.com/modelpack/model-csi-driver/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#helm-installation).

#### 3. Download A Model

To package a model, you need to download it to your local directory. The following example shows how to download a model from Huggingface.

```bash
export HF_MODEL="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"
export MODEL_PATH=my-model-directory

# Install the huggingface cli
pip install 'huggingface_hub'

# Login the huggingface cli
hf auth login --token <your-huggingface-token>

# Download a model
hf download $HF_MODEL --local-dir $MODEL_PATH
```

#### 4. Package Your First Model

The following script will walk through how to build a ModelPack format model artifact and push it to the model registry.

```bash
# Please modify the MODEL_REGISTRY environment variable to point to your OCI model registry
export MODEL_REGISTRY=myregistry.com

# If $MODEL_REGISTRY needs authentication, please login first
modctl login -u <username> -p <password> $MODEL_REGISTRY

# Generate a sample Modelfile, and edit the fields as needed
modctl modelfile generate $MODEL_PATH

# Build a model artifact from your model files
modctl build -t $MODEL_REGISTRY/mymodel:v1.0 $MODEL_PATH

# Push to an OCI registry
modctl push $MODEL_REGISTRY/mymodel:v1.0
```

#### 5. Use Models in Kubernetes

Here's an example Kubernetes pod spec that mounts a model artifact using the model CSI driver. The model will be available under the `/model` directory inside the container.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: model-inference-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: inference-server
      image: ubuntu:24.04
      command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: model-volume
          mountPath: /model
          readOnly: true
  volumes:
    - name: model-volume
      csi:
        driver: model.csi.modelpack.org
        volumeAttributes:
          modelRef: "myregistry.com/mymodel:v1.0"
```

This example shows how to mount a model artifact directly into a Kubernetes pod using the model CSI driver. The contents of the model is available within the /model directory within the running pod.
